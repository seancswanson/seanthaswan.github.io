          Basically I'm a pretty cool human who loves to breakdance, paint watercolor landscapes, go on long walks, read Eastern philosophy
          and anything fantasy/sci-fi, and it so happens that I'm also a web developer!
        </p>
        <p>
          As of Spring 2018: I am working as an apprentice web developer under

          I grew up in the beautiful Pacific Northwest where the rain falls aplenty and single-origin cold brew is the preferred stimulant.

          My most recent adventure was a 3-month immersive (and intensive) web development bootamp through General Assembly. Overall
          the curriculum included 400+ hours of class work, labs, projects and even a couple hackathons! Not only did I learn
          about JavaScript, React, web development best practices, and RESTful architecture- I also learned about the value
          of collaboration, team work, how necessary a skill time management really is... I came out of the experience with
          a whole new toolbelt with which to tackle my goals.

          My academic career was spent at the University of Washington in Seattle where I studied philosophy and read the classic curriculum
          of the Greek greats, found a fondness for Hume, had my foundations stripped by Descartes and discovered a curiosity
          for the sublime in Schopenhauer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sought answers to the questions about the nature of reality and personal purpose and came out with just more questions-
          big success!

          Throughout university and thereafter I continued to work as a professional fashion model and have travelled around the U.S.
          strutting down catwalks and shooting for online catalogues.

        <p>
          Currently I'm represented by TCM Models in Seattle, State MGMT in Los Angeles, and Major Models in Milano, Italy.

          I've been around tech my whole life with a father who worked for Nintendo, Taito, & Microsoft and a brother who studied 3D
          animation and went on to become a QA lead at Big Fish Games.

          My mother, being on the other side as a creative/maker, inspired my involvement in practicing art. These influences together
          have given me lenses that helped me fully appreciate the wonder and potential computers could offer.

          I consider myself a human of Renaissance ideals and as such my telos is geared towards fostering personal development and
          becoming a productive citizen of Earth. I am especially interested in contributing to projects involving education
          technology, environmental sustainability, and art!
