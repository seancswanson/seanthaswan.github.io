Welcome!
========

This is the latest version of my personal web development portfolio! As an experiment with online code editors and environments, I originally created this on [Glitch](glitch.com) and the imported the code to this GitHub repository. 

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.
